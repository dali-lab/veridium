# Veridium

VeRidium is a virtual reality science education platform that currently runs on the Meta Quest 2 and Meta Quest 3. Within the virtual environments, various modules from the science curricula can be chosen to augment high school and university teaching. VeRidium is free, will (soon) be made open source to evolve to a community driven project. All modules are peer reviewed to ensure scientific exactness.
